This library was made for a game called Laser Sea Destruction, and has expanded to be suitable for many other types of games. It has some features that are a little too far away from Processing's focus group of designers.

Some features are:

* Time-based animation
* Frame-map loading
* Image caching
* Tilemaps
* Reasonable 2D physics (This still needs work...)
* A display list so that sprites are shown in the correct order
* Some handy utility functions
* An organization framework for simple games

It's still in development and I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone just yet. But soon!
